#**Search Mining - with word2Vector**
-------------------------
#Introduction
Analyzing user searches is an influential aspect in the field of ad revenue and e-commerce revenue. In addition, to any entity, whether it be a corporate or a research group, user searches directly provide knowledge of the target user base. Our project focuses analyzing users’ action patterns and has succeeded in providing value as a technology and a service.

In terms of technology, our project overcame the limitations of the “bag of word” method by utilizing a deep learning method “word2vec”. Implementing the deep learning method resulted in a meaningful improvement in categorizing search queries.

Analysis of user action pattern can provide links amongst gender classification, category classification and related queries. Hence, it can be used in service.
